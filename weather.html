        <h1>Extreme Weather</h1>
        <p>
            Extreme events are occurrences of unusually severe weather or climate conditions that can cause devastating
            impacts on communities and agricultural and natural ecosystems. Weather-related extreme events are often
            short-lived and include heat waves, freezes, heavy downpours, tornadoes, tropical cyclones and floods.
            Climate-related extreme events either persist longer than weather events or emerge from the accumulation of
            weather or climate events that persist over a longer period of time. Examples include drought resulting from
            long periods of below-normal precipitation or wildfire outbreaks when a prolonged dry, warm period follows
            an abnormally wet and productive growing season.</p>

        <h1>Extreme weather: floods, droughts and heatwaves</h1>
        <p>
            Over the past decades, Europe has been experiencing frequent and severe weather and climate-related natural
            hazards like droughts, forest fires, heatwaves, storms and heavy rain. Climate change will make these events
            even more intense and more frequent.

            Extreme temperatures do not only impact the health of vulnerable groups but also cause sleep disturbance for
            everyone. Rivers and lakes are drying up, impacting all life dependent on them. Soils are also getting
            drier, increasing fire risks and reducing agricultural productivity.

            Other parts of Europe are experiencing intense downpours, sometimes flooding buildings and damaging property
            and infrastructure within a matter of minutes. Coastal zones will be at risk of more frequent storm surges,
            also resulting in flooded buldings or agricultural lands. Wind speeds are reaching levels never seen Europe
            before, causing accidents and serious damages to property. Other parts are seeing severe cold spells.</p>

        <h1>Weather Extremes</h1>
        <p>Weather extremes can have adverse effects on human health, including concerns from severe heat and cold.
            Storms and harsh conditions, such as hurricanes and droughts, can create secondary dangers, including floods
            and wildfires.
            Rising temperatures and the associated health risks are not felt equally across populations. Cities tend to
            get much warmer than their surrounding landscapes. This localized increase in heat is known as the urban
            heat island effect and occurs as paved, dark surfaces found on roads and buildings trap more heat than
            vegetated landscapes. Highly developed urban areas can have mid-afternoon temperatures that are 15°F to 20°F
            warmer than surrounding green areas. Importantly, urban neighborhoods that were subjected to historical
            redlining typically lack green space and often suffer effects of heat islands.

        <h1>The future</h1>
        <p>
            Protecting natural ecosystems and sustainably managing and re-establishing forests are important ways to
            reduce
            greenhouse gas emissions and slow down temperature rise in the short term by drawing down carbon dioxide
            from
            the atmosphere. At the same time, we must deeply and rapidly reduce global greenhouse gas emissions levels
            from
            fossil fuels – coal, oil and gas. If we do only the former and not the latter, we risk transforming more and
            more of our carbon sinks into carbon sources as climate change progresses.</p>
