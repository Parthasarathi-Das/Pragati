    <h1 style="margin-top: 100px;">Effects of Climate changes</h1>
    <p>Climate change is our planet’s greatest existential threat. If we don’t limit greenhouse gas emissions from the
        burning of fossil fuels, the consequences of rising global temperatures include massive crop and fishery
        collapse, the disappearance of hundreds of thousands of species, and entire communities becoming uninhabitable.
        While these outcomes may still be avoidable, climate change is already causing suffering and death. From raging
        wildfires and supercharged storms, its compounding effects can be felt today, outside our own windows</p>
    <h1>Effects of climate change on weather</h1>
    <p>As global temperatures climb, widespread shifts in weather systems occur, making events like droughts,
        hurricanes, and floods more intense and unpredictable. Extreme weather events that may have hit just once in our
        grandparents’ lifetimes are becoming more common in ours. However, not every place will experience the same
        effects: Climate change may cause severe drought in one region while making floods more likely in another.

        Already, the planet has warmed 1.1 degrees Celsius (1.9 degrees Fahrenheit) since the preindustrial era began
        250 years ago, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). And scientists warn it could
        reach a worst-case scenario of 4 degrees Celsius (7.2 degrees Fahrenheit) by 2100 if we fail to tackle the
        causes of climate change—namely, the burning of fossil fuels (coal, oil, and gas)</p>
    <h1>Effects of climate change on humans</h1>
    <p>Ultimately, the way climate change impacts weather, the environment, animals, and agriculture affects humanity as
        well. But there’s more. Around the world, our ways of life—from how we get our food to the industries around
        which our economies are based—have all developed in the context of relatively stable climates. As global warming
        shakes this foundation, it promises to alter the very fabric of society. At worst, this could lead to widespread
        famine, disease, war, displacement, injury, and death. For many around the world, this grim forecast is already
        their reality. In this way, climate change poses an existential threat to all human life..</p>

                <h3>sea level Rise</h3>
                <p>Deforestation is the permanent destruction of forests, usually for human activities like agriculture,
                    urbanization, logging, and mining. It leads to loss of biodiversity, climate change, soil erosion,
                    and water cycle disruption, threatening the environment, wildlife, and indigenous communities.
                    Sustainable forest management is crucial to mitigate its effects</p>

                <h3>Temperature Rise</h3>
                <p>The greenhouse effect is a natural process where certain gases (like carbon dioxide, methane, and
                    water vapor) in the Earth's atmosphere trap heat from the sun, keeping the planet warm enough to
                    sustain life. Human activities have increased these gases, intensifying the effect and leading to
                    global warming and climate change.</p>

                <p>Industries significantly impact the environment through air and water pollution, greenhouse gas
                    emissions, and resource depletion. Manufacturing processes release toxic chemicals, while extraction
                    and transportation of raw materials harm ecosystems. Additionally, industries contribute to
                    deforestation, habitat destruction, and climate change, affecting biodiversity and human health,
