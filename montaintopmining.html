        <h1>Definition of Mountain Top Mining</h1>
        <p>Mountaintop removal mining (MTR), also known as mountaintop mining (MTM), is a form of surface mining at the
            summit or summit ridge of a mountain. Coal seams are extracted from a mountain by removing the land, or
            overburden, above the seams. This process is considered to be safer compared to underground mining because
            the coal seams are accessed from above instead of underground. In the United States, this method of coal
            mining is conducted in the Appalachian Mountains in the eastern United States. Explosives are used to remove
            up to 400 vertical feet (120 m) of mountain to expose underlying coal seams. Excess rock and soil is dumped
            into nearby valleys, in what are called "holler fills" ("hollow fills") or "valley fills".

        <h1>Climate Changes for Mountaintop Mining</h1>
        <p>Strip mining across the mountaintops of Appalachia is scarring as much as three times more land to get a ton
            of coal than just three decades ago, new research shows.

            The data and a series of new maps that track the spread of surface mining across the region suggest that
            even as the industry has declined, what continues likely has an oversized impact on people and the
            environment.

            If mining companies have to do more blasting and digging for the same amount of coal, that means more dust
            in the air and more pollution in streams, said Appalachian Voices Programs Director Matt Wasson, who worked
            on the study with researchers from Duke University, West Virginia University, Google and SkyTruth.

        <h1>Environmental Impacts MountainTop Mining</h1>
        <p>MTR negatively impacts the environment. Practices of explosion and digging release many pollutants to the
            surrounding environment and community and alternation of the ecosystem. Associated air pollutants such as
            particulate matter, nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide not only raise health concerns, they also have effects
            on all ecosystems. Air pollution contributes to issues such as water and soil acidification, chemicals
            bioaccumulation in the food web and eutrophication.[44] Operations of valley fills buried more than 2,000 km
            of headwater and streams in the Appalachians. MTR reduces the freshwater resource that supports
            biodiversity. In addition, the operation provides opportunities for contamination leaching. Ca2+, Mg2+ and
            SO42− alter water chemistry by increasing pH, salinity and electrical conductivity. Increasing phosphorus
            and nitrogen can cause nutrient pollution. Selenium is toxic and can bioaccumulate.[45][46] Land disturbance
            from forestry cutting, soil and bedrock displacement/removal and use of heavy machinery can decrease soil
            infiltration rate, terrestrial habitat and carbon sequestration, increase in runoff and sediment weathering.
            As the consequence, hydrology, geochemistry and the ecosystem's health can be permanently impacted.[47][48]

        <h1>The future</h1>
        <p>
            Surface mining may be humanity's most tangible impact on Earth's surface and will become more prevalent as
            the energy transition progresses. Prediction of post-mining landscape change can help mitigate environmental
            damage, but requires understanding how mining changes geomorphic processes and variables. Here we
            investigate surface mining's complex influence on surface processes in a case study of mountaintop
            removal/valley fill (MTR/VF) coal mining in the Appalachian Coalfields, USA. The future of MTR/VF landscapes
            is unclear because mining's effects on geomorphic processes are poorly understood. We use geospatial
            analysis—leveraging the existence of pre- and post-MTR/VF elevation models—and synthesis of literature to
            ask how MTR/VF alters topography, hydrology, and land-surface erodibility and how these changes could be
            incorporated into numerical models of post-MTR/VF landscape evolution.
