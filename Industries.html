        <h1>Industrial pollution</h1>
        <p>In the most straightforward terms, industrial pollution is pollution whose source originates from industry.

            The industrial revolution brought more factories and technologies, which now stand to be blamed for the
            effect they’ve caused a lot of air, land, and water pollution on our planet over the years.This pollution is
            one of the worst because the smoke and other chemicals emitted by industries into the air contribute a lot
            to ozone depletion, global warming, and health problems for animals and humans.

            Moreover, these industrial pollutants release many harmful and unnatural chemicals into both soil and water,
            eventually leading to the extinction of some plant and animal species.

        <h1>"Industrial pollution"- The Danger</h1>
        <p>
            This pollution is one of the worst because the smoke and other chemicals emitted by industries into the air
            contribute a lot to ozone depletion, global warming, and health problems for animals and humans.

            Moreover, these industrial pollutants release many harmful and unnatural chemicals into both soil and water,
            eventually leading to the extinction of some plant and animal species.
            Agriculture is not far behind transportation in terms of the emissions it generates, with the WRI estimating
            farming is responsible for 13.8% of all greenhouse gases pumped into the atmosphere each year. In
            particular, activities that are associated with the rearing of livestock and dairy cattle are believed to be
            especially damaging, since these incur high levels of methane emission. Methane does not persist for as long
            in the atmosphere as carbon dioxide, but it can be up to 86 times more potent at trapping heat in the short
            term, which is why it’s become such a hot topic among environmentalists of late.</p>

        <h1>Reasons of Industrial pollution</h1>
        <p>Industrial pollution is directly linked with the factories and industries. These firms are responsible for
            polluting the environment. Different industrial activities, whether it is the extraction of raw material,
            processing, manufacturing, or waste disposal, leads to environmental degradation.Industrial pollution was
            started in contrast with the industrial revolution. Industrialization is one of the most significant
            achievements of us, simultaneously industrial pollution has been proved as the biggest curse not only for us
            but for the entire biodiversity of the planet. It is imperative to treat industrial pollution to save the
            environment. Industrial pollution is known to
            everyone that how it is damaging our environment. Here you can find out the major causes, effects, and
            preventive measures to control industrial pollution. It will help you to understand your role in preventing
            the environment from industrial pollution.

            <li><b>Industrial growth without proper planning </b>Unplanned industrial growth is one of the major causes
                of industrial pollution. In most of the industrial areas, the factories have ignored the standard rules
                and regulations for industrial setup. As a result, these industries have end-up polluting the air,
                water, and soil by releasing contaminants.


            </li>
            <li><b>Use of old technologies</b> Most of the factories and industries are relying on old technologies as
                updating advanced technologies is expensive as compared to out-dated ones. The old technologies generate
                a massive amount of toxins and waste than advanced technologies, hence polluting the environment
            </li>
            <li><b>Leaching of natural resources</b>Many factories need a considerable amount of raw material to produce
                the end-product. The raw material can be taken out from the Earth’s surface by the process called
                extraction. There are risk factors involved with the extraction of raw material when spilled on the
                Earth, causing soil pollution. </li>
            <li><b>Industrial Waste and Landfills </b>The industries and factories produce harmful gases which are
                released in the atmosphere.

            </li>
            <li><b>Improper waste disposal </b>Waste disposal through correct ways is crucial for the conservation of
                the environment, whether it is industrial waste or the waste we produce at our home. The waste generates
                in factories is much more harmful as it contains hazardous toxins and chemicals.

        <h1>The future</h1>
        <p>
            Industrial pollution mainly pollutes the air where we breathe. The industries emit a huge amount of harmful
            gases into the atmosphere daily. The process of emission will continue as these factories are running to
            fulfill our needs that are increasing rapidly every year.  Due to air pollution, respiratory problems like bronchitis, emphysema, asthma, etc. are quite common in
            people these days. Apart from this, long term exposure to low-quality air also leads to lung infections,
            coughing, sore throat, wheezing, headache, chest pain, nausea, high-level fatigue, etcMost of the factories
            required water to perform different activities to produce various products for consumers. When they use a
            large amount of water in various processes, it comes in contact with harmful chemicals, heavy metals,
            radioactive waste, etc.
