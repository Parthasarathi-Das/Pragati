        <h1>Climate Change Makes Cyclones More Intense and Destructive, Scientists Say</h1>
        <p>

            Climate change does not make cyclones, such as the one battering Bangladesh, more frequent, but it does
            render them more intense and destructive, according to climatologists and weather experts.

            These immensely powerful natural phenomena have different labels according to the region they hit, but
            cyclones, hurricanes and typhoons are all violent tropical storms that can generate 10 times as much energy
            as the Hiroshima atomic bomb.

            They are divided into different categories according to their maximum sustained wind strength and the scale
            of damage they can potentially inflict.</p>

        <p>
            Assessing the precise influence of climate change on individual tropical cyclones is challenging. The storms
            are relatively localised and short-lived, and can vary significantly in any case.
            But rising temperatures do affect these storms in several measurable ways.
            Firstly, warmer ocean waters mean storms can pick up more energy, leading to higher wind speeds.
            The forecast of between four and seven major Atlantic hurricanes in 2024 is partly because of record high
            Atlantic sea surface temperatures.
            The high temperatures are mainly due to long-term greenhouse gas emissions.
            Secondly, a warmer atmosphere can hold more moisture, leading to more intense rainfall.
            Climate change made the extreme rainfall from Hurricane Harvey in 2017 around three times more likely,
            according to one estimate.</p>

            there have been more storms, stronger hurricanes, and an increase in hurricanes that rapidly intensify. Thus
            far, most of these increases are from natural climate variations. However, one recent study suggests that
            the latest increase in the proportion of North Atlantic hurricanes undergoing rapid intensification is a bit
            too large to be explained by natural variability alone. This could be the beginning of detecting the impact
            of climate change on hurricanes, the paper states. In contrast, the frequency of hurricanes making U.S.
            landfall (a subset of North Atlantic hurricanes) has not increased since 1900, despite significant global
            warming and the heating of the tropical Atlantic Ocean.

            One current focus of hurricane research is “sampling hurricanes by flying into them for more accurate data,”
            says Shirley Murillo, deputy director of NOAA’s Hurricane Research Division. These higher-quality data are
            important for improving hurricane model forecasts now and in the future. NOAA partners with NASA to collect
            measurements of various aspects of hurricanes over time. “NASA weather satellites are a powerful tool for
            observations, as people cannot fly into every storm to gather data,” Murillo says. Satellites help expand
            the observational record. With a longer, more detailed record, scientists can detect changes in long-term
            data trends over time.

        <h1>The future</h1>
        <p>
            Protecting natural ecosystems and sustainably managing and re-establishing forests are important ways to
            reduce
            greenhouse gas emissions and slow down temperature rise in the short term by drawing down carbon dioxide
            from
            the atmosphere. At the same time, we must deeply and rapidly reduce global greenhouse gas emissions levels
            from
            fossil fuels – coal, oil and gas. If we do only the former and not the latter, we risk transforming more and
            more of our carbon sinks into carbon sources as climate change progresses.</p>
